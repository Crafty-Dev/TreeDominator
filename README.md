# TreeDominator
A plugin that allows the user to chop down entire trees by destroying just one block  <br/>
<br/>
--NOW WITH INTEGRATED FAST LEAF DECAY-- <br/>
--SUPPORTS 1.19 MANGROVE TREES--  <br/>
<br/>
There are a few options that can be changed in the config:  <br/>
<br/>
**maxBlocks** -> Defines maximum number of logs that can be chopped down at once  <br/>
**disableOnSneak** -> When true, the player can sneak to prevent chopping the whole tree  <br/>
**disableOnNotSneak** (since v0.3) -> When true, the player can stop sneaking to prevent chopping the whole tree  <br/>
**requiresAxe** -> When true, the player needs an axe to chop down the whole tree <br/>
**delayedBreaking** (since v0.2) -> When true, there is a short delay between the block destructions (Might look cooler)  <br/>
**dropTogether** (since v0.3) -> When true, all broken logs are dropped at the position the player has broken the first log <br/>
**fastLeafDecay** (since v0.3) -> When true, Leaves decay faster than normal (requires reload via /treedominator reload (May lag a few seconds))  <br/>
<br/>
After changing one of these values, the server must be reloaded <br/>
