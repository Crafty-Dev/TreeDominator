# TreeDominator
A plugin that allows the user to chop down entire trees by destroying just one block

--NOW WITH INTEGRATED FAST LEAF DECAY--
--SUPPORTS 1.19 MANGROVE TREES--

There are a few options that can be changed in the config:

maxBlocks -> Defines maximum number of logs that can be chopped down at once
disableOnSneak -> When true, the player can sneak to prevent chopping the whole tree
disableOnNotSneak (since v0.3) -> When true, the player can stop sneaking to prevent chopping the whole tree
requiresAxe -> When true, the player needs an axe to chop down the whole tree
delayedBreaking (since v0.2) -> When true, there is a short delay between the block destructions (Might look cooler)
dropTogether (since v0.3) -> When true, all broken logs are dropped at the position the player has broken the first log
fastLeafDecay (since v0.3) -> When true, Leaves decay faster than normal (requires reload via /treedominator reload (May lag a few seconds))

After changing one of these values, the server must be reloaded
